# Particle Relays Shield Fementation Temperature Controller

A simple fermentation temperature controller that makes full use of the Particle Photon Relay Shield to control heating and cooling for 2 fermenters as well as read the ambient temperature and glycol/chill water temperature.  

It was designed as an experimental replacement controller for the SS BrewTech FTSS controller, but given the relays can work with high voltage as well, it could turn a freezer and a heater on and off.
